# Dotnet Simple Library

I developed a simple library website using dotnet for this project. The main purpose was to get started with dotnet.

Using SQL and dotnet, I implemented CRUD operations and added systems like registering and logging in using Scaffold Identity. I also provided different privileges for Admin and Users on the website.
